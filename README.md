*Investigating the benefits of exploiting incremental learners under Active Learning scheme* - [link](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-19823-7_3)

This paper tackles with the concept of applying Active Learning concept exploiting incremental learners, based mainly on SGD approach. Several binary datasets have been assessed and the results under 3 separate labeled-ratio-scenarios are really promising, regarding both accuracy and time efficiency.

*Combining Active Learning with Self-train algorithm for classification of multimodal problems* - [link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8900724)

This paper is oriented towards the combination of Uncertainty Sampling Query Strategy with Self-training scheme under a common framework, so as to obtain improved learning behavior against supervised mode, exploiting useful information from available data without relying heavily on the human oracle, through which trustworthy decisions are drawn for the most ambiguous unlabeled instances.
